# ndarray-glm

Rust library for solving linear, logistic, and generalized linear models through
iteratively reweighted least squares, using the `ndarray-linalg` module.

## Status

This package is in early alpha and the interface is likely to undergo many changes.

### Prerequisites
fortran and BLAS must be installed:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gfortran libblas-dev
```

To use the OpenBLAS backend, install also `libopenblas-dev` and use this crate with the "openblas-src" feature.

### Features

- [X] Linear regression
- [X] Logistic regression
- [X] Generalized linear model IRLS
- [X] Linear offsets
- [X] Allow non-float domain types
- [X] L2 Regularization
- [ ] L1 Regularization (separate scaling for constant term?)
- [X] Generic over floating point type
- [X] Poisson
- [ ] Exponential
- [ ] Gamma
- [ ] Inverse Gaussian
- [ ] Other exponential family distributions
- [ ] Weighted regressions
  - [ ] Weight the covariance matrix with point-by-point error bars
  - [ ] Allow for off-diagonal correlations between points
  - [ ] Fix likelihood functions
  - [ ] Check the tolerance conditions for termination
- [ ] Non-canonical link functions

### TODO

- [ ] Generalize GLM interface to allow multi-parameter fits like a gamma
      distribution.
- [ ] Exact Z-scores by re-minimizing after fixing each parameter to zero
- [ ] Unit tests for correct convergence with linear offsets
